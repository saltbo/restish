# Restish v2 Design Records

These documents capture the design intent behind major Restish v2 features and
cross-cutting decisions.

They are primarily for contributors and AI agents working on the codebase.
They are not meant to be polished end-user documentation; the future docs site
can build on these records, but does not need to mirror their structure.

## Public Reader Guide

These records are public design notes, not the user manual. They explain how
Restish v2 is intended to behave and why major choices were made. For everyday
usage, prefer the docs site and command help.

Status labels mean:

- **Accepted**: intended v2 behavior unless a later design record changes it
- **Implemented**: accepted behavior that is also reflected in the current code
- **Historical**: evidence or inventory used to design v2, not normative v2
  behavior
- **Boundary**: a scope rule that says where authority lives and where it does
  not

Most records omit an explicit status label. Treat those as accepted subsystem
contracts once they appear in this corpus. If a record contains examples from
v1, a rejected alternative, or a compatibility note, that text is context for
the v2 decision rather than a promise to keep the old behavior.

They should now be treated as implementation-grade design records rather than
light sketches. A contributor should be able to read this corpus and recover:

- product goals and non-goals
- the "trust explicit operator intent" tenet: clear explicit user choices
  generally win over heuristics and extra ceremony, while hidden side effects
  still deserve guardrails
- persistent data models and compatibility rules
- request/response execution order
- extension points and lifecycle contracts
- security boundaries and failure handling
- expected user-facing behavior in both TTY and non-TTY use

The format is still not rigid, but "short because the code explains the rest"
is no longer the bar. If behavior matters to correctness, compatibility,
security, or user expectations, it should be captured here explicitly.

## Corpus Contract

The design corpus has two jobs:

1. define enough behavior to reimplement Restish v2 without reverse-engineering
   the current Go code
2. preserve the "why" behind decisions so release-window choices do not get
   reopened accidentally after v2 is stable

That means design records should describe product behavior, data contracts,
execution order, failure modes, and compatibility decisions. They should not be
used as a vague backlog, and they should not say "accepted" in two places with
conflicting answers. When two records start to overlap in a way that creates
two possible sources of truth, refactor them so the decision lives in one
owning record and the other record links to it.

The intended ownership is:

- subsystem records own detailed behavior for their subsystem
- [029-request-execution-pipeline.md](./029-request-execution-pipeline.md)
  owns end-to-end execution order
- [032-implementation-contract.md](./032-implementation-contract.md) owns the
  compact cross-cutting matrix of flags, config shape, command precedence, and
  plugin protocol families
- [037-v2-command-surface-review.md](./037-v2-command-surface-review.md) owns
  the accepted top-level command surface
- [000-restish-v1-baseline.md](./000-restish-v1-baseline.md) is historical
  evidence, not a v2 requirement

The order below is intentional. It starts with the highest-level core ideas,
then moves through request construction and API-aware behavior, then response
handling and operator workflows. Each document should ideally rely only on
concepts introduced earlier in the sequence.

## How To Read This Corpus

For an implementation or reimplementation effort, the recommended reading order
is:

1. read the foundations to understand the runtime shape, config model, body
   model, and security stance
2. read the request and API model to understand how commands are discovered,
   planned, and executed
3. read the response and data-flow records to understand normalization,
   filtering, streaming, pagination, retries, and rendering
4. read workflows and UX to recover interactive behavior, operator contracts,
   setup, and exit semantics
5. read extensibility last so plugin behavior is interpreted in the context of
   the host runtime rather than as a parallel architecture

When two records appear to overlap, the more specialized record should define
the subsystem-specific contract while the broader record explains how that
subsystem participates in the end-to-end pipeline.

## Reimplementation Checklist

A design-driven reimplementation should be able to recover at least the
following from this corpus:

- startup and runtime lifecycle
- persistent configuration files, profile layering, and migration boundaries
- command parsing, resolution, and generated API command behavior
- request-body construction, serialization, transport execution, auth, and TLS
- response decoding, normalization, filtering, formatting, and output framing
- streaming, pagination, retries, cache behavior, and cancellation semantics
- plugin discovery, lifecycle, trust boundaries, and host/plugin responsibility
- public Go API and plugin author contracts
- operator-facing diagnostics, prompts, shell setup, and exit behavior
- regression-test categories for v1 examples, binary fidelity, pagination
  stdout/stderr separation, OpenAPI edge cases, OAuth security boundaries,
  plugin protocols, and deterministic filesystem behavior

If an implementation detail is important to interoperability, security,
compatibility, or user expectations, it should live in one of these records
rather than remaining implicit in code.

Implementation simplicity is part of that bar. A reimplementation should prefer
one helper per runtime concern, standard library primitives over local
reimplementations, deterministic tests over sleeps or wall-clock assumptions,
and deletion of unused compatibility shims once v2 behavior is decided. These
are maintainability rules because duplicated helpers and timing-sensitive tests
were a recurring source of remediation work.
